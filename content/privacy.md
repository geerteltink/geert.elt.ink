## Why we value your privacy

We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organizations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.

## How we collect information

We ask for contact information including your name, email address, and phone number, on our website so that we can reply to your enquiry.

Our website doesn’t use cookies or scripts that were designed to track the websites you visit. We don’t use native social media ‘like’ or ‘sharing’ buttons which also build profiles of your internet activity.

We collect your email address when you sign up for one of our newsletters.

We ask for your account and contact information when you hire or buy something from us.

Occasionally, we might receive your contact information from one of our partners. If we do, we protect it in exactly the same way as if you give it to us directly.

We may use third-party web analytics services (such as Google Analytics) on our site to measure visitors. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site. You may [opt-out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) for this.

## What information we hold

When you contact us by email or through our website, we collect your name, email address, phone number, a social media username, and the company you work for, if you’ve given us that.

If you sign up for a newsletter, we only collect your email address.

If you do business with us, we also collect your business name and bank details and keep records of the invoices we send you and the payments you make.

## Where we store your information

When you contact us by email or through our website, we store your your information in Google Apps, our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. If you sign up for a newsletter, we store your email address in MailChimp which is the marketing platform we prefer. If we do business, we store your information in our accounts software [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/)). We chose these systems partly for their commitment to security.

## What we use your information for

We occasionally use your contact information to send you details of our products and services. When we do, you have the option to unsubscribe from these communications and we won’t send them to you again. We might also email or phone you about our products and services, but if you tell us not to, we won’t get in touch again. We will use your information to send you invoices, statements, or reminders.

The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.

## Who’s responsible for your information

Geert Eltink is responsible for the security of your information. You can [contact](/contact) him by email or by phone if you have any concerns about the information we store.

## Who has access to your information

When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need it have access. Our management team have access to everything you’ve provided, but individual employees have access to only what they need to do their job.

## How we keep your information private

Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people who need it. We store passwords in keepass, an encrypted password manager, use a different, randomly generated password for each service, and never use the same password twice.

The computers we use are all encrypted and are protected by a passcode or fingerprint access. These computers ask for authentication whenever they’re started or after 5 minutes of inactivity. Our mobile devices are also protected by a fingerprint or facial recognition.

## How to complain

We take complaints very seriously. If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways we handle your privacy, please contact me by [email](/contact) or by [phone](/contact). If you’re the letter writing type, send your [envelope](/contact).

## Changes to the policy

If we change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment we publish them on our website.
