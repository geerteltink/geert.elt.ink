# Sharing

I've learned a thing or two over the years when working as a developer. I love
sharing what I've learned an am using this site for that.

> The difference between knowledge and wisdom is experience.

I choose a skill I want to be good at. After that I do the research and will
will get my hands dirty while experimenting to uncover its principles. To be
able to write and / or teach I need real experience.

# Career

It started back in 1999 when I got involved in a startup which listed all
available daily menus of the local restaurants. The programming languages
I learned from my business information technology wasn't proficient and
I taught myself PHP. My lack of architecture skills forced me to be inventive
and I used a customized news publishing platform for it.

That news publishing platform was my first open source experience and I started
making contributions. After a while it got me my first lead developer position.

I always had plenty of work offered via my network which got me started as a
freelance developer. I started with html sites, WordPress sites and plugins.
Eventually I got bigger jobs to build sites and even an auction platform from
scratch for which I used CodeIgnitor, Symfony and Laminas (FKA Zend Framework).

Server maintenance, deployments and setting up CI is something I learned and
loved as well and I have extended my knowledge with JavaScript frameworks
like VueJS and AngularJS.

During my freelance time, I've worked alone and in teams as a developer, team
lead and architect.

In 2019 I got tired of chasing clients for payments and wanted to work in a
bigger company. Januari 2020 I started as a Senior Software Engineer at
[ottonova](https://www.ottonova.de/).
