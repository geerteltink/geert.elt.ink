I live in the south of spain, surrounded by sea and mountains, focused on
designing, developing and publishing things to the web.

Job titles can be misleading and often don't reflect what someone really
does. I fall somewhere in the cross-section of a web designer, front-end
and back-end developer, devops specialist and a project and small team manager.

I love creating and designing web applications and managing your next project.
I’ll be dedicated to create the most effective approach that aligns with your
business objectives, attracts your target audience, and sustainably grows your
organization.

Talk to me about the interaction of design and content, optimizing content
updates, streamlining and automating workflows and tasks, project management,
web development, mountainbiking, diving and sushi.
