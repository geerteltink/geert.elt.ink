I grew up in the Netherlands and am currently based in the south of Germany,
surrounded by lakes and mountains, focused on developing and deploying things
to the web.

I love designing and developing web applications and make ideas a reality.
I’ll be dedicated to create the most effective approach that aligns with your
business objectives, attracts your target audience, and sustainably grows your
organization.

Don’t think of me as a freelancer, think of me as part of your team. I work
closely with my clients and integrate into their workflow.

Talk to me about UX design, optimizing content delivery, streamlining and
automating workflows and tasks, web development, to use or not to use
javascript, mountain biking, diving and sushi.

Geert.
