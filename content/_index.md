I grew up in the Netherlands and am currently based in the south of spain,
surrounded by sea and mountains, focused on designing, developing and
deploying things to the web.

Job titles can be misleading and often don't reflect what someone really
does. I fall somewhere in the cross-section of a web designer, front-end
and back-end developer and a devops specialist.

I love designing and developing web applications and make your idea a reality.
I’ll be dedicated to create the most effective approach that aligns with your
business objectives, attracts your target audience, and sustainably grows your
organization.

Talk to me about UX design, optimizing content delivery, streamlining and
automating workflows and tasks, web development, to use or not to use
javascript, mountain biking, diving and sushi.

Any ideas or projects? Just send me a message

Geert.
