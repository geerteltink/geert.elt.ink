## Working on side projects

Besides contributing to [laminas](https://getlaminas.org/) and [mezzio](https://getmezzio.org/), there are not many side
projects going on at the moment.

## Working on a client project

For a client I'm still building a PHP based API server powered by mezzio. Its purpose is to feed configuration and content to several company websites, auction sites and webshops, all build with Angular.

## Health insurance

Since Januari 2020 I started working ottonova, bringing digital health insurance to Germany. I enjoy working in a team and it
turns out it's something I missed the passed years as a freelancer. Because health insurance is so complex and we build most
stuff in house, there is never a boring day.

## Doing sports when not working

This may include, but is not limited to, mountain biking, (trail) running, yoga and diving.
