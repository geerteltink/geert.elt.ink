## Working on side projects

I just finished [research](../blog/2019-11-09-project-documentation.md) on automating documentation generation for multiple projects within an organization. Now it's time to apply this to the Zend Framework documentation. And I'm also looking into automatically merging pull requests and creating releases with GitHub Actions.

## Working on a client project

For a client I'm building a PHP based API server powered by zend-expressive. Its purpose is to feed configuration and content to several company websites, auction sites and webshops, all build with Vue.js.

## Test driving

Once in a while I'm test driving cars for brake refinement, quality assurance and durability, for Valmet Automotive Spain. Besides the quality assurance part it has nothing to do with my designer and programmer life, but it clears my head and gets me away from the screen.

## Doing sports when not working

This may include, but is not limited to, mountain biking, (trail) running, yoga and diving.
